# Sudoku-Solver
A Sudoku Solver using the pygame library.

The sudokuGUI.py contains the main GUI code that uses pygame. It displays the graphical grid and has options for the user to enter the 
numbers in the grid. Interactive colors are used effectively to make the grid easier to work with.

This file also contains many game logic functions that depend on a lot of the files variables and dictionaries.

The gridNotation.py mainly contains the notation generation algorithms that are used to grant access to each of the squares of the puzzle.
It also contains certain functions to refresh values of dictionaries, as they are notation dependent.

The sudokuAlgo.py is the core game logic. It does not have any gui code in it. It is basically a constrictive algorithm that is used to
solve the puzzle once the user has entered the puzzle in the main GUI application. It takes the entered data from the GUI application, solves
the puzzle and then returns this value to the GUI program to display the result on the grid.
